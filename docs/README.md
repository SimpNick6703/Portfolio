# Portfolio Documentation

This folder contains the built static files for the portfolio website.

These files are automatically generated from the React application in the `frontend` directory.

## Deployment

This folder is used for GitHub Pages deployment. The site is built from the `frontend` directory and the output is placed here for GitHub Pages to serve.

## Do Not Edit

⚠️ **Do not manually edit files in this directory.** They will be overwritten during the build process.

To make changes to the website, edit the source files in the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
